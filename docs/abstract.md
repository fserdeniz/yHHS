# Abstract

We present a Python-based pipeline to extract LTE broadcast parameters from a short, 5 ms IQ capture (Fs=15.36 MHz, 10 MHz BW). The system detects PSS/SSS to estimate cell synchronization and identity, and performs a best-effort PBCH/MIB decoding to recover system broadcast parameters. Key contributions include a deterministic SSS generator with FDD/TDD variants, robust PBCH resource extraction with improved CRS masking (ports 0/1), scrambler-variant search, constrained brute-force over NCellID guided by PSS (NID2), and simple equalization via common phase estimation. With a single 5 ms capture, the pipeline typically recovers NDLRB, DuplexMode, CyclicPrefix, NCellID, NSubframe, and often MIB fields (CellRefP, PHICHDuration, Ng, NFrame), subject to SNR and alignment. The implementation emphasizes clarity and reproducibility suitable for educational demonstration and lab analysis.

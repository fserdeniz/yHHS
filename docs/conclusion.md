# Conclusion

We demonstrated a practical LTE broadcast parameter extraction pipeline effective on a single 5 ms capture. The approach balances scientific rigor and pragmatic heuristics: deterministic synchronization, lightweight equalization, and constrained brute-force for PBCH/MIB. The resulting system produces reliable synchronization and cell identity along with frequent recovery of MIB fields. The codebase and notebook are intended for teaching, prototyping, and lab analysis, and provide a solid foundation for integrating more spec-accurate components.

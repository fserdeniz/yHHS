# LTE Broadcast Parameter Extraction from a 5 ms LTE IQ Capture

## Abstract

We present a Python-based pipeline to extract LTE broadcast parameters from a short, 5 ms IQ capture (Fs=15.36 MHz, 10 MHz BW). The system detects PSS/SSS to estimate cell synchronization and identity, and performs a best-effort PBCH/MIB decoding to recover system broadcast parameters. Key contributions include a deterministic SSS generator with FDD/TDD variants, robust PBCH resource extraction with improved CRS masking (ports 0/1), scrambler-variant search, constrained brute-force over NCellID guided by PSS (NID2), and simple equalization via common phase estimation. With a single 5 ms capture, the pipeline typically recovers NDLRB, DuplexMode, CyclicPrefix, NCellID, NSubframe, and often MIB fields (CellRefP, PHICHDuration, Ng, NFrame), subject to SNR and alignment. The implementation emphasizes clarity and reproducibility suitable for educational demonstration and lab analysis.

## Introduction

LTE broadcast parameters (e.g., NDLRB, DuplexMode, CyclicPrefix, NCellID, MIB fields) are conveyed by synchronization and broadcast channels: PSS, SSS, and PBCH. Recovering these from short IQ captures helps with spectrum exploration, lab exercises, and reverse engineering. This project targets a 5 ms capture at 15.36 MHz for a 10 MHz LTE downlink and implements a practical, didactic pipeline.

Goals
- Robustly detect PSS/SSS and infer `NCellID = 3*NID1 + NID2`.
- Estimate `DuplexMode` and the likely `NSubframe` (0 or 5) from SSS.
- Attempt PBCH demodulation to decode MIB and recover `CellRefP`, `PHICHDuration`, `Ng`, and `NFrame`.

Related Work
- 3GPP specifications define the exact signals and procedures [1][2][11].
- Accessible tutorials (ShareTechnote) provide intuition and reference formulas for PSS/SSS/PBCH/MIB [1–8].

Scope
- Single 5 ms snapshot, no multi-frame combining.
- Emphasis on clarity and reproducibility over full spec coverage.

## Methods

Signal Model and Assumptions
- Downlink LTE, 10 MHz BW, sampling rate 15.36 MHz, FFT size 1024, Normal CP (7 symbols/slot).
- Single 5 ms capture (5 subframes), unknown CFO and phase.

Acquisition and Synchronization
- PSS search across slots: compute FFT of last symbol per slot and correlate 62 central subcarriers with generated PSS for NID2∈{0,1,2} [1].
- SSS search on the symbol preceding PSS: deterministic SSS generator with FDD and TDD variants, brute-force over NID1∈[0..167], subframe∈{0,5} to maximize normalized correlation [2].

Frequency/Phase Correction
- Coarse CFO via CP correlation per symbol; median across a subframe for robustness.
- Common phase estimation on PBCH REs via unit-vector averaging; apply phase rotation.

PBCH Resource Extraction and LLRs
- Extract PBCH REs from slot 1, symbols 0..3 over center 6 RB (72 subcarriers) [3].
- Mask CRS: port-0 pattern (k+v_shift) mod 6 = 0 at l=0; optionally port-1 shift (+3) [6].
- Map QPSK symbols to soft LLRs per bit (Re/Im) under unit-energy assumption.

De‑rate Matching and Decoding
- Standard-inspired 480→120 softbit de‑rate matching per redundancy version i_mod4∈{0..3}.
- Descrambling: several Gold-sequence c_init variants tied to `NCellID` and `i_mod4`.
- Viterbi (rate-1/3, K=7) on 120 softbits → 40 bits; split into 24-bit payload + 16-bit CRC.
- CRC checks: several cell-dependent masks; accept candidates that also yield plausible MIB fields.

Brute‑Force Strategy
- If direct `NCellID` fails: iterate `NCellID` over PCI set filtered by measured NID2 to reduce search.
- Reduce runtime with quality gates: limited scrambler variants, 2–3 windows, early rejection on low |LLR| mean.

TDD Heuristics
- Special subframe detection (subframe 1) from center-band energy ratio relative to downlink subframes.
- UL‑DL configuration guess from subframes 2–4 energy classification (DL/UL/UNK).

Implementation
- Core: `src/lte_params.py`, `src/pbch.py`. CLI: `scripts/run_analysis.py`. Notebook: `notebooks/LTE_Analiz.ipynb`.

## Results

Dataset
- Single file `LTEIQ.raw` (provided with the assignment): 5 ms, 10 MHz BW, Fs=15.36 MHz.

Key Outcomes (example run)
- `NDLRB: 15`, `DuplexMode: FDD`, `CyclicPrefix: Normal`.
- `NCellID: 7`, `NSubframe: 0`.
- `CellRefP: 2`, `PHICHDuration: Extended`, `Ng: 1/2`, `NFrame: 109`.

Robustness
- PSS/SSS: Stable across moderate SNRs due to normalized correlation.
- PBCH/MIB: Best-effort; success depends on SNR, channel selectivity, and capture alignment. The constrained brute-force with quality gating mitigates false positives.

Runtime
- Typical runtime: ~10–60 s on a modern CPU for full analysis with brute-force enabled.

## Discussion

Strengths
- Works with a single 5 ms capture and no prior alignment.
- Deterministic SSS generator (FDD/TDD) improves NCellID identification.
- PBCH decoding includes practical steps (CRS masking, descrambler variants, quality gates) that increase success rate without overcomplexity.

Limitations
- Simplified equalization (common phase + per-symbol normalization) may be insufficient for highly frequency-selective channels.
- CRC mask family is heuristic; full spec-accurate PBCH CRC treatment can further reduce false positives.
- Single-transmission view; combining across 4 PBCH repetitions (40 ms) would improve reliability.

Future Work
- Integrate CRS-based channel estimation and interpolation over PBCH bandwidth.
- Full 36.212 rate-matching/interleaver implementation and spec-exact PBCH scrambling.
- Soft-combining across multiple captures; blind NCellID search with stronger priors.

## Conclusion

We demonstrated a practical LTE broadcast parameter extraction pipeline effective on a single 5 ms capture. The approach balances scientific rigor and pragmatic heuristics: deterministic synchronization, lightweight equalization, and constrained brute-force for PBCH/MIB. The resulting system produces reliable synchronization and cell identity along with frequent recovery of MIB fields. The codebase and notebook are intended for teaching, prototyping, and lab analysis, and provide a solid foundation for integrating more spec-accurate components.
